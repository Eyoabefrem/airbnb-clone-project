## Technology Stack

This project uses a modern full-stack architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and responsiveness. Below is a breakdown of each technology and its purpose in the project.

### 1. **Django**
A high-level Python web framework used for building robust, scalable backend systems. It provides built-in tools for user authentication, database ORM, and admin interfaces—ideal for managing dynamic content.

### 2. **PostgreSQL**
An advanced open-source relational database system used to store structured data such as users, listings, bookings, and reviews. It integrates seamlessly with Django and supports complex queries and data integrity.

### 3. **GraphQL**
An API query language used to fetch only the data needed by the frontend, reducing payload size and improving performance. It provides flexible and efficient data retrieval compared to traditional REST APIs.

### 4. **React**
A JavaScript library used to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React allows component-based development and efficient UI updates, enhancing user experience.

### 5. **Tailwind CSS**
A utility-first CSS framework used for styling. It provides pre-defined classes for rapid UI development and responsive design without writing custom CSS.

### 6. **Docker**
A containerization tool that ensures the app runs consistently across different environments. It simplifies deployment by packaging the app and its dependencies into isolated containers.

### 7. **Git & GitHub**
Version control tools used for managing source code and collaboration. GitHub hosts the repository, tracks changes, and supports pull requests and issue tracking.

### 8. **GitHub Actions**
Used for automating CI/CD pipelines. It runs tests, builds, and deployment scripts whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

---

Together, these technologies support a robust and efficient development process from backend logic to frontend presentation and deployment.

## Database Design

- A user can write multiple reviews.

---

### 2. **Property**
Represents listings available for booking.

**Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)

---

### 3. **Booking**
Represents a reservation made by a user for a property.

**Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → User)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Property)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`
- `status` (e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled)

**Relationships:**
- A booking is made by one user.
- A booking is for one property.
- A booking may be associated with one payment.

---

### 4. **Review**
Represents user feedback for properties.

**Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → User)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Property)
- `rating` (1-5)
- `comment`
- `created_at`

This schema ensures clear data relationships and supports all the core features required in an Airbnb-style platform.

## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project replicates key functionalities of the real Airbnb platform to deliver a seamless user experience. Below are the main features and their purpose within the application.

### 1. **User Management**
Handles user registration, login, and authentication. Supports different user roles (guest or host) with secure access control to relevant features such as listing properties or making bookings.

### 2. **Property Management**
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details like title, description, location, pricing, and availability, making it easy for guests to browse and select suitable accommodations.

### 3. **Booking System**
Enables guests to book available properties by selecting date ranges. The system ensures no overlapping reservations and tracks booking status (e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled).

### 4. **Review and Rating System**
Lets users leave feedback on properties they’ve stayed in. This builds trust and credibility among users, and helps others make informed decisions based on previous experiences.

### 5. **Search and Filter Functionality**
Provides dynamic search features with filters for price, location, availability, and property type. Enhances user experience by allowing quick discovery of relevant listings.

### 6. **Payment Integration**
Processes secure payments for bookings using mock or third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe or PayPal). Ensures users receive confirmation and receipts for their transactions.

### 7. **Responsive UI Design**
The frontend is fully responsive, ensuring smooth performance on both desktop and mobile devices. This improves accessibility and usability across platforms.

### 8. **Host Dashboard**
Hosts have access to a personalized dashboard to manage their listings, track bookings, and view guest reviews. This centralized control panel improves host efficiency and platform usability.

These features work together to provide a comprehensive and scalable accommodation booking platform.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect sensitive user data, maintain system integrity, and build trust in the platform. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented in this project:

### 1. **Authentication**
Only registered users can access protected endpoints. We will implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify users' identities and ensure session validity.

*Why it matters:* Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive operations like bookings, payments, or profile changes.

---

### 2. **Authorization**
Ensures that users only perform actions they are allowed to. For example, only hosts can manage their property listings, and only guests can book properties.

*Why it matters:* Prevents data tampering or misuse of functionality by users with the wrong privileges.

---

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
Limits the number of API requests a user or IP can make within a time frame to protect against brute-force attacks and abuse.

*Why it matters:* Helps defend against denial-of-service attacks and preserves system stability under high traffic or malicious behavior.

---

### 4. **Data Validation and Sanitization**
All input data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

*Why it matters:* Prevents malicious payloads from compromising the database or frontend interface.

---

### 5. **HTTPS Enforcement**
All data exchanged between the client and server will be encrypted using HTTPS.

*Why it matters:* Protects user credentials, personal information, and payment data from being intercepted over the network.

---

### 6. **Secure Payment Handling**
Payments will be processed via third-party providers like Stripe or PayPal, avoiding direct handling of credit card data.

*Why it matters:* Reduces the security liability and ensures compliance with industry standards (e.g., PCI-DSS).

---

These security measures collectively ensure that user data, financial transactions, and platform operations are protected from malicious actors and vulnerabilities.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are a crucial part of modern software development. They automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code whenever changes are pushed to the repository, ensuring fast and reliable delivery of updates.

### Why CI/CD is Important

- **Consistency:** Ensures code is always tested and deployed in a standardized way.
- **Speed:** Reduces manual steps and allows faster iteration through automated workflows.
- **Reliability:** Automatically runs tests to catch bugs early and reduce the chance of breaking production.
- **Collaboration:** Helps multiple developers work together by validating every contribution before it’s merged.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows such as testing, linting, and deployment every time code is pushed or a pull request is created.
- **Docker:** Provides consistent environments for running tests and deploying applications in containers.
- **Render / Vercel / Netlify:** Can be used for automatic deployment of the frontend or backend after a successful CI run.

CI/CD pipelines help maintain a smooth and professional development cycle, ensuring every update is delivered efficiently and with confidence.
